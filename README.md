## 🚀 Projects

Here are some of my recent projects:

### LevelUp 🎮
- Utilized React and Redux to create a dynamic and user-friendly front-end experience, while using Python and Flask to handle back-end functionality such as database management and API integration. 

- Implemented the game and reviewed features, including integrating game logic, building a database schema, and constructing user authentication and authorization.

### Pinspired 📌
- Partnered with a team of five developers to create a full-stack Pinterest clone using React, Redux, Python, and Flask, resulting in four key features: pins, boards, followers, and profiles. 

- Designed and implemented complicated relationships between pins, boards, and users, including mirroring the relationships found on Pinterest, and created a profile page that showcased users' boards and pins. 

- Demonstrated stellar collaborative skills by working with a group of developers to complete this complex project, which closely mimics real-world development scenarios. Assumed the lead on all code reviews, feature implementation, and conflict resolution, while driving the project to it’s completion.
